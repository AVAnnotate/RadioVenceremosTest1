De one of protests and of funerals, They’re the same ones.  Arms and legs and shoulders and feet,  They’re the same ones. At a gallop, they’re the same ones. The faces with eyes that throw lances at a gallop, Over the historic güiscoyol of the same souls, They’re the same ones. Except for today there aren’t enough streets, Or parks, Or mountains, For us, The same ones, Loud Pipiles in protest and at a gallop. Working men, Laboring fists, Women who smell of vegetables in the marketplaces. There isn’t any space in this small country for the peasant, Heart of golden grain, We continue at war, Our same unique song is heard everywhere. Peace, peace, and we are the same."

The workers Carlos Ibrian Resinos and Jose Alirio Martinez were assassinated this past Tuesday, May 26th, by police officers dressed as civil society, according to reports by factory workers from the candy factory Delicia. The police officers were controlling the workers' entrance, inconspicuously posted in front of the factory when the unionists arrived. They shot them at point-blank range."
